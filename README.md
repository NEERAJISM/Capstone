## Regime-based Pair-Trading Model for Intraday Mean Reversion in Indian Stock Markets

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source ./venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Place the **unzipped** folders in the `2021/` or `2022/` directories.  
   ⚠️ Note: Unzipping `.rar` files can be tricky on Windows.  
   ✅ TODO: Consider using Docker to simplify the setup process.
